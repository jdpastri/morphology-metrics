This repository adds supplementary material for the following paper, published in 2021 in Knowledge and Information Systems:

Pascual-Triana, J.D., Charte, D., Andrés Arroyo, M. et al. Revisiting data complexity metrics based on morphology for overlap and imbalance: snapshot, new overlap number of balls metrics and singular problems prospect. Knowl Inf Syst 63, 1961–1989 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-021-01577-1j.cor.2020.104979.


Here, three different files, each including the theoretical overlap (only for the artificial datasets), the value of each metric and the classification results, per dataset, are provided. Each file shows the results for different types of dataset: balanced artificial, imbalanced artificial and real datasets.

1. "Balanced artificial dataset results"

1. "Imbalanced artificial dataset results"

1. "Real dataset results"

Likewise, three other files that present the correlations between the results from the complexity metrics and the classification of said datasets are provided.

1. "Balanced artificial dataset correlations"

1. "Imbalanced artificial dataset correlations"

1. "Real dataset correlations"
